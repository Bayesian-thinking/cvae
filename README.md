# cvae
This is an implementation of conditional variational autoencoders inspired by the paper [Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generative-models) by K. Sohn, H. Lee, and X. Yan.

The formatting of this code draws heavy influence from [Joost van Amersfoort's](https://github.com/y0ast/VAE-Torch) implementation of Kingma's variational autoencoder. Simply run to train the conditional VAE: `th main.lua`
